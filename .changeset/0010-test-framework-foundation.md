Add complete xUnit-style test framework with automatic database transaction rollback and colorized console output. Includes TestCase base class, 15 assertion methods, convention-based test discovery, sequential test runner, and Minitest-style reporter. Tests automatically run in isolated database transactions that rollback after completion.
